# Modulr demo project

This project is a little test-bed to help me understand how Modulr works. Modulr
is a script concatination and genration tool similar to Sprockets, but uses
the CommonJS API to declare which files should be merged.

`modulrized.js` is the file generated by running:

`$ modulrize main.js > modulrized.js`
