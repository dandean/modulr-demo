# Modulr demo project

This project is a little test-bed to help me understand how Modulr works. Modulr
is a script concatenation tool similar to Sprockets, but uses the CommonJS API
to declare which files should be merged at build time.

`modulrized.js` is the file generated by running:

`$ modulrize main.js > modulrized.js`

## Modulr

To learn more about Modulr, take a peek at the project on Github:

[http://github.com/codespeaks/modulr](http://github.com/codespeaks/modulr)

## Try it for yourself

    $ sudo gem install modulr
    $ git clone git://github.com/dandean/modulr-demo.git
    $ cd modulr-demo
    $ modulrize main.js > modulrized.js
    $ open ./index.html

Take a look at `main.js` and each of the files within `lib/` to get an idea of
how all of the scripts tie together. The result is viewable within `modulrized.js`.
